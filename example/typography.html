      <h2> Belote <small>(game)</small> </h2>

      <article>

        <p> <strong>Belote</strong> is a 32-card <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trick-taking_game">trick-taking game</a> played in France, and is one of the most popular card games in that country. It was invented around 1920, probably from Klaverjas, <i>Klaverjassen</i>, a game played since at least the 17th century in the Netherlands.<sup>[1]</sup>
          Closely related games are played throughout the world, and its rules first published in 1921.<sup>[2]</sup> </p>

        <p> In Bulgarian it is called <b>Bridge-Belote</b> <i lang="bg">(Бридж-белот)</i>, in Greece it is called <b>Bourlot</b> <i lang="gr">(Μπουρλότ)</i>, in Cyprus it is called <b>Pilotta</b> <i lang="cy">(Πιλόττα)</i>, in Quebec the word was shortened to the first syllable and spelled <i>bœuf</i>, and in Croatian a similar game with different rules exists, called <b>Bela</b>. In Saudi Arabia it is <b>Baloot</b>. In Bulgaria it is usually called <b>Belot</b> <i lang="bg">(Белот)</i>. In Republic of Macedonia it is <b>Belyot</b> <i lang="mk">(Бељот)</i> and it is especially played in Bitola region. Belot in Armenia, more commonly known as <b>Bazaar Belote</b> <i lang="hy">(Բազառ Բլոտ)</i>, is also a very popular game, and it is played in a <em>slightly</em> different way. It is also the number one card game in Saudi Arabia; although, the rules in the Saudi version are <em>very</em> different from the rules generally played by in Europe.

        <h3>Rules</h3>

        <p> The game is played differently in different locations, but most versions share a considerable set of common rules. A typical 32-card piquet deck is used and <em>not</em> shuffeled between games. The game is played by four people, forming two teams: North-South and East-West, and playing in turn in counterclockwise direction. </p>

        <h4>Dealing</h4>

        <p> The deck is never shuffled, but rather cut by the player who precedes the dealer, except for the first dealing in a game when the dealer's partner does that. The first dealing in a game is done by the winners from the previous game. At least three cards must be cut. </p>

        <p> The cards are dealt counter-clockwise starting from the dealer's successor (to his/her right), each player receives a packet of three cards, then another set of two. The rest of the cards remain temporarily face-down. If a contract is agreed upon, the remaining cards are dealt after the bidding — a group of three for each player. </p>

        <h4>Bidding</h4>

        <p>
          The possible contracts are (from lowest to highest):
          <ol>
            <li> Clubs ♣ </li>
            <li> Diamonds ♦ </li>
            <li> Hearts ♥ </li>
            <li> Spades ♠ </li>
            <li> "No trumps" </li>
            <li> "All trumps" </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          Every player must either suggest a higher contract, or bid:
          <ul>
            <li> Pass </li>
            <li> Double, if the current highest contract was not bid by the partner </li>
            <li> Re-Double, if the other team have doubled
              <ul>
                <li> bidder's contract </li>
                <li> bidder partner's contract </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <h2>Tracy's Tiger <small>(snippet)</small></h2>

      <article class="indent">
        <h3> Chapter 6 </h3>
        <p> What hearts have broken in times gone by,
          what hearts break now in our own times,
          what hearts shall break in times to come,
          Nimmo gone, Laura Luthy lost, Shively in
          the Tasting Department at last, Peberdy
          and Ringert treating him like a dog,
          frequently questioning his taste, looking at
          one other knowingly. </p>
        <p> The three lines of Tracy’s turned out to be,
          as so many other things turn out to be, dirt.
          <mark>The song faded away, the very scrap of
          paper on which Tracy had so carefully
          written the words was lost, the melody
          was forgotten.</mark> </p>
        <p> Tracy and the tiger walked on Sunday to
          Saint Patrick’s on Fifth Avenue, burning
          with the fervor of an old and undefined
          religion that somehow seemed new, each
          of them walking in man’s or animal’s
          loneliness. </p>
        <p> They went in and looked at everything. </p>
        <p> The following Saturday Tracy quit his job
          at Otto Seyfang’s and went back to San
          Francisco. </p>

        <hr>

        <p> <q>What do you mean?</q> Laura said.</p>
        <p> <q>I don’t know,</q> Tracy said. <q>I suppose I
          mean – you’re still the most beautiful girl
          in the world.</q> </p>
        <p> <q>I’m not,</q> Laura said. </p>
        <p> <q>Yes, you are,</q> Tracy said. <q>You are
          to <em>me.</em></q> </p>
        <p> <q>No,</q> Laura said. <q>It’s so arrogant to be
          beautiful. It’s such bad taste. It’s so
          pathetic, too. So much more pathetic than
          just lying still and knowing you’re dead.</q> </p>
        <p> <q>You’re not dead, Laura.</q> </p>
        <p> <q>Oh, I am.</q> </p>

        <h4>Quotes</h4>

        <blockquote>
          <p> As for Tracy, he shook hands with
            everybody. He believed they were sincere.
            Either that, or helpless. </p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <p> I don’t know how
            you feel, but I feel Tracy’s crazier than
            anybody knows, or ever will know. How
            do you feel?</p>
